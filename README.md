Libraries and their use

pandas (pd): Used for data manipulation and analysis with DataFrames.

numpy (np): Used for numerical operations and array manipulations.

matplotlib.pyplot (plt): Used for creating visualizations and plotting data.

seaborn (sns): A powerful library for creating visually appealing statistical graphics.

sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score: A function from scikit-learn (sklearn) to calculate the accuracy score for classification models.

sklearn.datasets: A module from scikit-learn that provides datasets for practicing and testing machine learning algorithms.

The dataset contains the following columns:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PassengerId: A unique identifier for each row (passenger).

Survived: The target variable we want to predict, indicating whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0).

Pclass: The socio-economic class of the passenger, which is a categorical ordinal feature with three unique values (1, 2, or 3) representing upper, middle, and lower classes, respectively.

Name: The name of the passenger.

Sex: The gender of the passenger (male or female).

Age: The age of the passenger.

SibSp: The number of siblings and spouses traveling with the passenger.

Parch: The number of parents and children traveling with the passenger.

Ticket: The ticket number of the passenger.

Fare: The fare paid by the passenger.

Cabin: The cabin number of the passenger.
